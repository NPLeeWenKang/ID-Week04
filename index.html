                    I am Lee Wen Kang, and I am currently a year 1 Information Technology student in Ngee Ann
                    Polytechnic. There are several pushing factors that motivates me to work hard. One of them would be
                    having a challenge, I enjoy feeling the sense of accomplishments when I solve problems, that is why
                    I enjoy programming and math. Another motivation is the want to keep improving myself. Personally, I
                    enjoy learning new thing as I am able to better explore my interests and understand more about the
                    world.

                        <p>Skills: React, Python, C#.</p>
                        <p>I believe everyone knows what python and C# are, however React might be unknown to some.
                            React is a Javascript framework that aids in the production
                            of web applications. These web applications are usually dynamic websites (the way it looks
                            depends on the data present). To learn React, I started off making a Trello list clone. I
                            started out learning the basics and understanding the syntax. However after not long after,
                            I decieded to embark on a personal project to recreate Discord (chat app). This allowed me
                            to better understand React and other cloud computing services like Firebase.</p>
